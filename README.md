# Machine Learning Specialization – Coursera (by Andrew Ng)

This repository contains my solutions and notes for the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) offered by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford University, taught by Andrew Ng.

This 3-course series provides a practical and theoretical foundation in Machine Learning using Python and NumPy, with hands-on assignments and conceptual explanations.
